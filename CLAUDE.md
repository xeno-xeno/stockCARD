## Project Overview

This is a React-based Stock Ticker Quiz game where users guess company names from stock ticker symbols. The project is documented in `project_files.md` which contains the complete file structure and code for setting up the application.


**Single Page Application Structure:**
- `src/App.jsx` - Root component that renders the main quiz component
- `src/components/StockTickerQuiz.jsx` - Core game logic and UI containing all quiz functionality
- `src/main.jsx` - React app entry point with StrictMode
- `src/index.css` - Global styles with Tailwind imports


## File Organization

The project follows a simple React structure with all business logic centralized in the main quiz component. The `project_files.md` contains the complete codebase that can be used to recreate the entire project structure.
